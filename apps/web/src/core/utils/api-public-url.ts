/**
 * Public, absolute URL of the API as seen from the user's browser.
 *
 * Server reads the explicit public API URL directly. Client reads from
 * the runtime config injected into window.__KODUS_PUBLIC_CONFIG__ by
 * the root layout — same pattern as self-hosted.ts. Module-scope client
 * callers (e.g. ssoLogin in lib/auth/fetchers.ts) need a window-backed
 * getter because they can't call useConfig().
 *
 * Prefers WEB_PUBLIC_API_URL when explicitly configured (self-hosted
 * public API origin, e.g. the Caddy front). Then API_URL — the public,
 * browser-reachable API origin (the same env the API's SAML callbacks
 * use). Falls back to WEB_HOSTNAME_API / WEB_PORT_API, the in-cluster
 * Service address for the web pod's server-side /api/proxy/api/* calls,
 * so self-hosted installs that have only the proxy host configured (or
 * neither) still build the URL they always did.
 *
 * Returns "" when not configured. Callers MUST handle the empty case
 * (typically: refuse to start the flow with a clear error) rather
 * than building a broken URL with an empty origin.
 *
 * Always strip a trailing slash so callers can concatenate paths
 * without thinking about it.
