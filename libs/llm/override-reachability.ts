/**
 * "Did the override the user pasted actually reach the request?"
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The Custom reasoning override is a free-text JSON box. Save time already
 * rejects JSON that does not PARSE. The other half is JSON that parses fine and
 * is then dropped between us and the wire — every AI SDK adapter validates its
 * `providerOptions` against a schema that STRIPS unknown keys, silently, with no
 * warning and no error. From the user's side that is indistinguishable from a
 * provider that ignored them.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical. A live org runs Claude with
 *   { "thinking": { "type": "adaptive" }, "output_config": { "effort": "high" } }
 * which is the shape Anthropic's own API docs show. `@ai-sdk/anthropic` declares
 * that field as `effort` and renders `output_config` itself, so the pasted half
 * is stripped: they get adaptive thinking at the default effort and have never
 * been told.
 *
 * WHY NOT A PER-PROVIDER KEY LIST
 * The obvious fix is for each module to declare the keys its adapter accepts.
 * That is a second copy of a schema the SDK already owns, in twelve files, and
 * every one of them is a fact that can rot without anything noticing — the exact
 * shape of bug this file exists to catch. The SDK will not hand us the schema
 * either (only the TYPE is exported), so the copy could not even be checked.
 *
 * So the question is answered from EVIDENCE instead: `include: { requestBody:
 * true }` gives back the body the adapter actually built, and a key that
 * survived left its values in it.
 *
 * WHY VALUES AND NOT KEY NAMES
 * Because renaming is normal and correct: the user writes `effort` and the wire
 * carries `output_config.effort`; `thinkingBudget` becomes
 * `generationConfig.thinkingConfig.thinkingBudget`. Matching names would flag
 * every faithful translation. Values survive renaming — `"high"` is still
 * `"high"` — so a key is "reached" when at least one of its own leaf values
 * appears somewhere in the body.
 *
 * The bias is deliberate: a value that collides with an unrelated one in the
 * body reads as reached, so this UNDER-reports. A false alarm would teach people
 * to ignore the warning, which costs more than a miss.

/**
 * "The effort the user picked produced nothing the provider will see."
 *
 * A SECOND silent drop, same shape as the first but from the opposite side: not
 * a key the adapter rejected, one we never sent. Across production, 24 slots
 * carry a reasoning effort that leaves no trace in the request, for three
 * different reasons — and the user was told about none of them:
 *
 *   - the model does not reason at all (`gemini-2.0-flash`, `gpt-4o-mini`);
 *   - the model reasons but is behind a proxy alias we cannot name
 *     (`kodus-review`, `auto`, `cc/claude-opus-5`), where withholding is the
 *     deliberately safe answer;
 *   - the model reasons, we know exactly which it is, and the transport has no
 *     mapping — Grok / MiniMax / Kimi on Bedrock Converse.
 *
 * Only the third is a gap in our code, and it is NOT closed by guessing a field
 * name: AWS documents Grok's `reasoning.effort` for its Responses API and shows
 * no reasoning parameter in its Converse example, so an invented
 * `additionalModelRequestFields` entry risks a ValidationException on every
 * review — trading a setting that does nothing for a provider that answers
 * nothing. Worse, not better.
 *
 * From the user's chair all three are one thing: they picked High and it does
 * not happen. That is what this reports.
 *
 * `reasoningOptions` is what the provider module produced for this effort — the
 * reasoning payload ALONE, not the resolved bag, so OpenRouter routing riding
 * along cannot be mistaken for reasoning that landed.
