 * "Does this model reason, and how" had two answers living in two dispatchers
 * with disjoint family lists — `model-reasoning.ts` knew claude/gemini/openai,
 * `reasoning-traits.ts` knew glm/kimi/deepseek — and each returned a perfectly
 * valid-looking "no" for the other's families. Nothing failed. The UI simply
 * told a customer their Kimi has no reasoning.
 *
 * Both now read `detectModelFamily`. This file is what keeps them reading it:
 * every member of the `ModelFamily` union needs a row, and each row states BOTH
 * answers. A family added to the union with no row fails the coverage test; a
 * family added with a row that only one resolver can answer fails its own.
