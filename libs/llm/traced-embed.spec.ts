/**
 * Embeddings need the same wall-clock floor model calls have.
 *
 * Both production callers are fail-soft against ERRORS — the dedup guard
 * catches and falls back to a lexical veto, `document.ts` has no catch at all
 * — and neither is protected against SILENCE. A request that never answers
 * throws nothing, so the catch never runs and the stage waits forever, which
 * is precisely how the agent loop hung on 2026-09-03.
*
 * The per-test 15s budgets are not slack: `hardTimeout` grants ms + 5s of
 * grace so a provider that DOES honour the abort settles on its own first, so
 * a 40ms ceiling resolves at ~5.04s — just past jest's 5s default. Declared
 * per test rather than via a CLI flag, which a plain `pnpm test` never passes.
