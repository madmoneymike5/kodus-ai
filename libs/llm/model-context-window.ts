 * It used to run FIRST, and by SUBSTRING, which made it the most dangerous table
 * in the file. `claudeopus4` swallowed claude-opus-4-7 and -4-8 — the substring
 * matches — and pinned two models that hold 1,000,000 tokens to 200,000. `gpt5`
 * did the same to gpt-5.5 and the gpt-5.6 line, and `deepseekv4flash` to a model
 * upstream rates at 1,048,576. Every one of those is a live production slot, and
 * an eightfold under-chunk is invisible: it costs calls and context, never an
 * error. Matching is now EXACT on the normalized name.
 *
 * Add a key only when upstream genuinely lacks the model, and drop it once
 * upstream has it — `scripts/refresh-model-context-windows.mjs` is what keeps
 * upstream current, so a hand-typed number is a stopgap, never the source.
