/**
 * The agent loop must have a wall-clock floor under it.
 *
 * `AbortSignal` is the polite first try. Several OpenAI-compatible proxies
 * accept the connection, ignore the abort, and never answer — `llm-call.ts`
 * says so in as many words ("some providers ignore AbortSignal; this is the
 * safety net") and wraps the ONE-SHOT path in `hardTimeout` for exactly that.
 * The loop had no such net, and the loop is where reviews run.
 *
 * What that cost on 2026-09-03: a review's generalist agent stopped logging
 * mid-run. Nine pipeline stages reported `completed in Xms`; `AgentReviewStage`
 * reported nothing, ever. The PR kept the "review starting" comment the
 * pipeline had already posted, the sandbox lease stayed held, the span stayed
 * open, and nothing was logged as an error — a promise that never settles
 * throws nothing for a `catch` to see. The e2e gave up after its own 53-minute
 * budget, well past the 30-minute ceiling that was supposed to apply.
 *
 * These tests stub `generateText` to that exact shape — never settles, ignores
 * the signal. Without the wrapper they hang until jest kills them; with it they
 * reject as `[HARD-TIMEOUT]`.
*
 * The per-test 15s budgets are not slack: `hardTimeout` grants ms + 5s of
 * grace so a provider that DOES honour the abort settles on its own first, so
 * a 40ms ceiling resolves at ~5.04s — just past jest's 5s default. Declared
 * per test rather than via a CLI flag, which a plain `pnpm test` never passes.
