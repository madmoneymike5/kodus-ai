/**
 * The connection probe's ONE call — issued through the same montagem a review
 * uses, not a hand-rolled copy of it.
 *
 * Why this exists: the probe used to rebuild the request itself with axios (a
 * `/models` GET for native brands, a hand-written chat body for the compatible
 * ones). That copy could not help drifting from runtime — it never emitted
 * reasoning at all, sent temperature on only one of the two transports, and had
 * no case for Azure, so "Test" reported OK for configs a review would reject.
 *
 * Here the slot goes through `resolveModelConfig` — the same resolver
 * `structured-review-call` and `agent-loop-call` use — so every per-model fact
 * the provider modules own (Kimi k2.7-code's pinned temperature and
 * undisableable thinking, Anthropic 4.7+ rejecting sampling params, a brand's
 * reasoning schema) applies to the probe for free, and keeps applying when a
 * module changes. Divergence stops being something to remember and becomes
 * impossible.
