/**
 * Pure, transport-agnostic validation of the tuning a user configured for a BYOK
 * slot (temperature + reasoning effort) against the MODEL's own rules — the same
 * `temperaturePolicy` / `reasoningTraits` the runtime obeys. Asks the provider
 * module (via REGISTRY), so it stays provider-blind and a new model is a data
 * change in the module, never an edit here.
 *
 * Why it exists: the runtime SELF-CORRECTS these values (`resolveByokTemperature`
 * sends a `fixed` temperature OVER whatever is stored, and omits an `unsupported`
 * one), so a mis-set value never 400s — it is silently ignored. That silence is
 * the problem: a user who pins Kimi k2.7-code to 0.2 believes it takes effect. The
 * connect-time Test surfaces the mismatch out loud instead, so the client learns
 * the value won't be used BEFORE saving a config that quietly disagrees with it.
