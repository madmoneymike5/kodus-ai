/**
 * Runtime model FAILOVER — cascade `primary → fallback` when a call fails.
 *
 * The routing layer (`resolveTaskSlot`) already decides WHICH model runs a task
 * and stamps the org's configured fallback onto `slot.fallback`. This owns the
 * OTHER half: when the model that ran actually FAILS at call time in a way a
 * different model can fix, re-run the call once on the fallback. It is the
 * OUTERMOST retry — it wraps the executor, which already owns the same-model
 * recovery (SDK per-step retry, the one-shot D-00c re-issue, the limiter's
 * cooldown). So a model is only abandoned after it has exhausted its OWN retries.
 *
 * This is NOT a runtime failover cascade of N models: at most one hop
 * (primary → fallback), matching the single `routing.fallbackModelId` the user
 * configures. `fallback` is a deliberate backup (often a cheaper/steadier model),
 * not "the next tier" — the selection precedence (per-agent → default) is a
 * SEPARATE concern owned by the router, not re-walked here.

/**
 * Should a failed call cascade to the FALLBACK model? True only when a DIFFERENT
 * model can plausibly fix it — the whole point of a per-org fallback:
 *  - TERMINAL model-specific failures (bad/expired key, out of credit, unknown
 *    model, access denied): the primary provably can't serve this org/task.
 *  - A TRANSIENT (5xx / network) blip that OUTLIVED the executor's same-model
 *    retries — persistent enough that the provider itself looks down.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT cascaded (a peer model doesn't help, or another layer owns it):
 *  - RATE_LIMIT that the limiter can still wait out — it owns backoff/cooldown, and
 *    swapping models on a 429 would defeat the rate gate. A 429 that already
 *    EXHAUSTED the executor's same-model retries DOES cascade: backoff is the cure
 *    for a real rate limit, so outliving it disproves the label (see
 *    `retriesWereExhausted`).
 *  - CONTEXT_OVERFLOW — the prompt is too big; a same-class fallback won't fit it.
 *  - Abort / hard-timeout — the failure is latency or a cancel, not the model;
 *    re-running burns the whole timeout budget again.
 *  - UNKNOWN — unclassified; stay conservative rather than spend a 2nd billed call.
