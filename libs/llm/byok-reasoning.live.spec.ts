/**
 * BYOK reasoning LIVE contract — "does the shape we emit still WORK upstream?"
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS EXISTS, SEPARATELY FROM byok-config-matrix.spec.ts ────────────
 * The offline matrix proves that a stored config produces the request body we
 * intend. It cannot prove that body is still CORRECT, because that fact lives on
 * the provider's side and changes on the provider's timeline. The regression we
 * keep hitting is exactly that: a model changes how it is configured, our
 * request quietly stops meaning what it meant, and nobody finds out until a
 * customer's reviews get worse.
 *
 * So this tier issues a REAL, minimal call per brand, through the production
 * path: `LLM.run` → slot resolution → failover → executor → the vendor.
 *
 * ─── IT ASSERTS THE EFFECT, NOT JUST THE ABSENCE OF AN ERROR ────────────────
 * The dangerous drift is SILENT. If a vendor renames `thinking` or stops
 * honouring `reasoning_effort`, the request still returns 200 — it just stops
 * reasoning, and the only visible symptom is worse review quality weeks later.
 * A test that only asserts "no 400" would stay green through exactly the
 * failure it was written to catch. So for every brand we ask for reasoning, we
 * assert the response actually BILLED reasoning tokens.
 *
 * ─── CREDENTIALS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every credential is a GitHub Actions secret, passed by the `byok-live` job in
 * .github/workflows/contract-tests.yml. There is no override file and no JSON
 * blob: a brand reads the secret `REPO_SECRET` names for it, or derives
 * `BYOK_<BRAND>_API_KEY`, and a brand that borrows reads the lender's.
 *
 *     BYOK_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   -> anthropic, -modern, -opus-5, openai_compatible_claude
 *     BYOK_OPENAI_API_KEY      -> openai, openai_compatible_gpt5
 *     BYOK_ZHIPU_API_KEY       -> zai, zai_glm53 (Zhipu is Z.ai, the GLM vendor)
 *     BYOK_GOOGLE_API_KEY      -> google_gemini, google_gemini_flash
 *     BYOK_MOONSHOT_API_KEY    -> moonshot_code
 *     BYOK_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY    -> deepseek
 *     BYOK_OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY -> open_router, _glm, _qwen
 *     BYOK_AMAZON_BEDROCK_API_KEY -> amazon_bedrock (bearer token)
 *
 * Adding a brand needs no code beyond its row: create `BYOK_<BRAND>_API_KEY`,
 * pass it in the workflow, and the invariants at the bottom of this file check
 * the two against each other in BOTH directions — a secret nobody reads and a
 * row nothing can authenticate are each a failure, not a silent skip.
 *
 * A case with no key SKIPS — it never fails. A run with partial credentials
 * reports partial coverage, so contributors and forks see green, not a false red.
 *
 * ─── ONE KEY, SEVERAL BRANDS ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The Claude brands hold the SAME key — they are generations and transports of
 * one account, split into separate brands only because their request shapes are
 * mutually exclusive. `BORROWS_FROM` is what says so, in one place, instead of
 * each row naming an env var and the two drifting.
 *
 * The baseURLs written into the rows are the vendors' public endpoints, kept in
 * the file because reading a row should tell you which vendor it talks to. They
 * are not configuration: changing where a row points is a code change, reviewed
 * like any other, now that there is no secret that can silently redirect it.

/**

 * lists drifted twice in a single day: the job passed `BYOK_GOOGLE_API_KEY`
 * while the Gemini row read two names that are repo secrets nowhere, and an
 * earlier commit had to delete four `API_*` names that resolved to nothing on
 * every run. Both are the same defect — the credential a brand uses was stated
 * in two places, and only one of them was ever checked.
 *
 * Renaming these to a single convention was the other option and it is closed:
 * all seven are load-bearing in other workflows (`BYOK_OPENAI_API_KEY` alone is
 * read by six), so the legacy names stay and this table is where the mapping
 * lives. Any brand NOT listed derives `BYOK_<BRAND>_API_KEY`, so a new brand
 * needs no entry unless its secret is already called something else.

 * The invariants at the bottom of this file check the table against the

/**
 * The rows above prove the reasoning parameter reaches the vendor. They do NOT
 * prove the thing production actually does, because they call the model the way
 * no production code does: a plain message list with no schema, through the SDK
 * rather than through the one door.
 *
 * There IS one door — `LLM.run` — and it owns three things before any executor
 * runs: the slot resolution (task -> model + key), the observability span, and
 * the primary->fallback cascade (`runWithModelFailover`). Underneath it picks an
 * executor: agent loop, structured, or text. So these go through `LLM.run`
 * itself; reaching for `runStructuredReviewCall` beneath it would skip the
 * routing and the failover, which is the same mistake one level down.
 *
 * The structured executor chooses an OUTPUT CHANNEL from `planStructuredCall`
 * before it ever touches the SDK:
 *
 *   as-is              issue the structured call unchanged
 *   suppress-thinking  turn reasoning OFF first, THEN force the tool — because
 *                      the Anthropic protocol rejects a forced tool_choice while
 *                      thinking with "tool_choice 'required' is incompatible
 *                      with thinking enabled"
 *   reroute-json       never force a tool at all; put the schema in the prompt —
 *                      for models that cannot stop thinking AND cannot take a
 *                      forced tool_choice.
 *                      NO LIVE ROW covers this: the only model that needed it
 *                      (k3 over the Anthropic protocol) is served from
 *                      api.kimi.com/coding, which answers Unauthorized for the
 *                      same key api.moonshot.ai accepts — a separate coding-plan
 *                      subscription, not a credential we hold. The plan is still
 *                      selected in production, so this is a real gap.
 *
 * Those two non-trivial plans are the 400s this whole layer exists to prevent,
 * and no amount of plain-generateText coverage can see them: the failure needs a
 * schema, a forced tool call and a thinking model in the same request. So these
 * go through the REAL entry point, with the real schema machinery, and assert
 * the parsed object comes back.
