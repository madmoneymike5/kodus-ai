/**
 * The ONE way every LLM consumer turns a resolved BYOK slot into a ready-to-call
 * model invocation — the composition point for the cross-cutting knobs that used
 * to be re-assembled (and drift) at every call site.
 *
 * A `NormalizedModel` slot in → the four things every generateText/agent call
 * needs out:
 *   - `model`           — built from the slot + wrapped in the BYOK limiter /
 *                         failure reporter (via `resolveAgentModel`).
 *   - `modelName`       — the human `provider:model` label for the telemetry span.
 *   - `callOptions`     — per-model tuning (`temperature` / `maxOutputTokens`)
 *                         from the SHARED `resolveSlotCallOptions` mapping.
 *   - `providerOptions` — provider-specific reasoning/thinking + OpenRouter
 *                         routing from the SHARED `buildProviderOptions` mapping.
 *
 * Why this exists: the conversation agent, the business-rules analyzer, the skill
 * fetcher and the review finder each hand-rolled this block. The copies drifted —
 * one dropped the slot's `temperature`, another dropped `reasoningConfigOverride`,
 * another read `slot.maxOutputTokens` without the "≤0 means default" guard. That
 * class of silent divergence is exactly what a single derivation removes: a new
 * agent (or a new provider) honors the slot's tuning + reasoning for free.
 *
 * Scope: SLOT-DERIVED config only. Deliberately NOT here — telemetry spans,
 * abort/timeout signals, retry policy and usage recording, which legitimately
 * differ between the one-shot structured path and the agentic loop. Consumers
 * still own those; they just stop re-deriving the model/tuning/reasoning wrong.
