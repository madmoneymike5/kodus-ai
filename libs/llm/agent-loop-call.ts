/**
 * The AGENT-LOOP half of `LLM.run` — a tool-driven, multi-step model call.
 *
 * `runReviewCall` (structured-review-call.ts) is the one-SHOT half: one prompt,
 * one response. This is the LOOP half: the AI SDK's `generateText` with `tools`
 * + `stopWhen` runs many steps (call tool → read result → decide → repeat) until
 * it answers or hits `maxSteps`. Both halves are reached through the SAME
 * `LLM.run`; the only difference is whether `loop` is present.
 *
 * The point of this file: the model concerns live HERE, once — never re-hand-rolled
 * by the agent runner. It owns exactly what the one-shot owns:
 *   - access   : slot → model (BYOK or managed) via `resolveModelConfig`
 *   - tuning   : temperature / maxOutputTokens from the slot's callOptions
 *   - reasoning: providerOptions from the slot
 *   - cache    : the prompt-cache breakpoints (system + latest user + last tool),
 *                a provider concern — applied here because we know the slot
 *   - repair   : `repairToolCall` re-issues against THIS model (never a system one)
 *   - tracing  : ONE observability span that records the run's usage (aggregate)
 *
 * The harness runner supplies only the LOOP seams (`tools`, `maxSteps`,
 * `stopWhen`/`prepareStep`/`onStepFinish` built from its policies) and the
 * messages — no model, no tuning, no span. It maps the returned result onto its
 * own RunState. This file never imports the harness (keeps the dependency arrow
 * agent-harness → @libs/llm; the seams are plain AI SDK shapes it forwards).
