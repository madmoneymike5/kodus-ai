/**
 * Structured single-shot LLM call for the review pipeline, on the LOCAL
 * (Vercel AI SDK) stack — no legacy PromptRunnerService.
 *
 * Model policy (1 model per task — no runtime error-recovery fallback):
 *   - the run resolves ONE model: the org's BYOK model, or our managed default
 *     when no BYOK (`accounts/fireworks/models/deepseek-v4-flash` on Fireworks —
 *     resolved by buildModelFromSlot).
 *
 * There is NO 2nd-model cascade: no managed Groq for trial orgs, no
 * `byok-fallback` for BYOK orgs. A model failure/timeout fails the call. The
 * only retry is the D-00c latency guard below — ONE re-issue of the SAME model
 * on a transient (5xx/network) blip; it never touches a 2nd model.
 * (Reliability caveat accepted 2026-07-29; resilience is re-addressed in Phase 5.)
