/**
 * Contract test: pins KODUS_TRIAL_MODEL to a real, callable model at
 * Fireworks — not to whatever the CI workflow's own hardcoded default says.
 *
 * Bug this exists to catch (PR #1734, "fix(code-review): Fixing model
 * name"): KODUS_TRIAL_MODEL is a hardcoded model id, used as the default
 * for every trial org and every self-hosted install with no BYOK
 * configured (referenced from commentManager.service.ts,
 * build-orchestrator-input.ts, documentation-search-exa.service.ts,
 * kody-rules-model-policy.ts, reference-detector.service.ts — a one-line
 * regression here breaks review/conversation/kody-rules for every trial
 * org at once). Fireworks deprecated `deepseek-v4-flash` in favor of a
 * dated version (`-0731`); nothing caught the old id going stale until it
 * broke in production.
 *
 * The existing e2e preflight check (tests/e2e/lib/llm-preflight.ts) DOES
 * call this model for real during matrix runs — but through
 * API_LLM_PROVIDER_MODEL, a value the CI workflow hardcodes SEPARATELY
 * from this constant. If someone updates KODUS_TRIAL_MODEL here without
 * updating that workflow default (or the reverse), the preflight keeps
 * silently checking a value that no longer matches what the product
 * actually ships — exactly the drift that let this go stale. This test
 * imports the constant directly, so there is no second value to drift
 * from.
 *
 * Needs a live Fireworks-compatible key — skips (not fails) when
 * E2E_LLM_API_KEY/API_OPEN_AI_API_KEY isn't set, same convention as
 * llmPreflight. Not run by the default fast unit pass in practice (no key
 * in that job's env); runs for real wherever E2E_LLM_API_KEY is available
 * (the self-hosted e2e matrix job already has it).
