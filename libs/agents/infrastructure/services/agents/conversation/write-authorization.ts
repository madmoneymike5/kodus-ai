/**
 * Refuses a write that nobody declared — at execution, not by hiding the tool.
 *
 * Hiding it was the first attempt, and it backfired: the model looked at what
 * it had, concluded "I don't have a tool to save memories", and told the
 * developer it couldn't help — even when the developer had just asked it to.
 * Reasoning from what it observes beats any instruction telling it otherwise.
 *
 * So the tools stay visible. A write that has not been authorized returns a
 * refusal explaining how to get authorized, which the model can act on in the
 * same turn. The guarantee is unchanged — nothing reaches org state without a
 * declared, quoted action — but the failure mode is now a retry instead of a
 * dead end.
