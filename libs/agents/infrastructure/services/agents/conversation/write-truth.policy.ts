/**
 * Keeps the model's account of the turn honest by putting the turn's facts in
 * front of it: before each step it is told which write tools have actually run
 * so far. Without this it decides an action is warranted and then reports it as
 * done — on a fresh thread, with nothing executed.
 *
 * Rides the `injectNote` seam, which is kept out of the message window on
 * purpose so the cached prompt prefix survives the injection.
