/**
 * The turn's decision, made explicit.
 *
 * Answering the developer, judging whether they asked for something, and
 * choosing to act were all happening inside one free-text generation, with no
 * point where the decision existed as something we could inspect or enforce.
 * It went wrong in both directions — writing unasked, and staying silent on a
 * thread that plainly revealed a convention.
 *
 * So the agent now has to commit: one call to `kodusDecideAction` naming what
 * it intends. The runner collects that call as the run's artifact (it is the
 * spec's `resultToolName`), the write gate reads it before letting any tool
 * change org state, and the provider compares it afterwards against what the
 * tools really did.
