/**
 * Watches for the agent declaring an action, and authorizes the write when it
 * does — the developer's own words being the authority.
 *
 * The policy does not take tools away. An earlier version did, and the model
 * read the absence as incapacity: told to save a memory, it answered that it
 * had no tool for it. The tools stay in front of it now; what changes is
 * whether they will actually run (see `requireDeclaredAction`).
