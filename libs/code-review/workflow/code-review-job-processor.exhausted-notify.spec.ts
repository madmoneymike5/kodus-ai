/**
 * Tell the author once, and do not stop telling them because of a crash.
 *
 * `process()` does not check job status on entry, so a redelivery — a broker
 * retry, or the stale-job reaper picking the row back up — runs the exhausted
 * branch again. `notifyReviewFailed` reaches the pull request author, so a
 * repeat is visible to a customer.
 *
 * Gating that on `status === FAILED` looked like the fix and was a trap:
 * `handleFailure` writes that status whether or not anyone was ever told. A
 * crash between the two, or a notify that failed inside its own catch, leaves
 * the job FAILED forever and every later attempt skips the notice — which is
 * the "review failed and nobody was told" defect this branch exists to
 * prevent, reintroduced by its own guard.
 *
 * The marker therefore records the NOTIFICATION, and lives somewhere the
 * failure path does not write.
