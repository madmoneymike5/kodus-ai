/**
 * Turn the reviewer's internal WHAT/WHY/HOW structure into prose, without a
 * model.
 *
 * The finder is INSTRUCTED to produce that structure — see the `writingPolicy`
 * blocks in `review-prompt-blocks.ts`, which tell it to write "1. WHAT: … 2.
 * WHY: … 3. HOW: …". It is scaffolding for the model's own reasoning, and the
 * LLM formatter pass is the only thing that ever converted it into something a
 * person should read.
 *
 * So when that pass produces nothing, the scaffolding ships. Production, twelve
 * hours: 86 of 732 formatter runs (11.7%) returned an empty map, and every
 * suggestion in those batches reached a customer's pull request with the labels
 * intact. The causes were five and unrelated — a suspended account (55), the
 * 90-second ceiling (25), a parse failure, a model id that does not exist, a
 * rate limit — and all five converge on that same empty map.
 *
 * A remote call is the wrong last line of defence for this. Removing three
 * labels is a text operation: it cannot time out, cannot be rate limited, and
 * does not care whether the account has credit. The LLM pass stays what it was
 * — the polish, which reads better — and this becomes the floor under it.
 *
 * Deliberately conservative. It reformats only what it recognises as the
 * template and returns the input untouched otherwise: a suggestion that was
 * already prose must not be rearranged by a fallback.
 */

/**
 * A label, wherever it appears.
 *
 * Matched in every form seen in production rather than only the one the prompt
 * asks for: at the start of a line, or mid-sentence ("WHAT: x. WHY: y. HOW: z."
 * on a single line is common); with or without the numbered prefix; and with
 * markdown emphasis models add unprompted — including `**WHAT:**`, where the
 * emphasis closes AFTER the colon.
 *
 * Matching the numbered prefix as part of the label is what keeps a bare "1."
 * from surviving as its own fragment.
 *
 * The third alternative is what makes the NUMBERED list work when a model
 * flattens it onto one line: "1. WHAT: a 2. WHY: b 3. HOW: c". Without it the
 * labels still came off (the '.' of "2." satisfies the punctuation rule) but the
 * list numbers were left stranded mid-sentence — "a 2. b 3. c." Requiring a
 * numbered prefix to FOLLOW keeps it narrow: prose has no number there, so
 * "Here's why:" is still untouched.
 *
 * TWO deliberate restrictions, both there to protect prose:
 *
 * A mid-line label must follow sentence-ending punctuation. Allowing it after
 * any non-space character made "Here's why: the guard was removed" look like
 * scaffolding, and this runs on the FALLBACK path — so a false positive does
 * not merely fail to help, it rewrites a good suggestion into "Here's the guard
 * was removed." and ships that. Before this fallback existed, prose survived a
 * failed model pass untouched; it has to keep surviving.
 *
 * And the match is case SENSITIVE. The prompt spells the labels in capitals and
 * models keep them that way, while "why:" and "how:" are ordinary English. The
 * trade is the right way round: missing a lowercase label ships scaffolding,
 * which is the bug we already had, whereas matching prose corrupts a finding
 * that was fine.
