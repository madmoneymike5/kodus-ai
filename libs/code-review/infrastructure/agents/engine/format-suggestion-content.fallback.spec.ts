/**
 * The floor has to be WIRED to every way the model pass can fail.
 *
 * `stripReviewScaffolding` is covered on its own. What this pins is that no
 * path out of `formatSuggestionContent` can still hand the caller an empty map
 * while the suggestion carries WHAT/WHY/HOW — because the caller's loop over an
 * empty map leaves the raw content in place and it ships to the pull request.
 *
 * The five production causes in twelve hours were a suspended account (55), the
 * 90-second ceiling (25), a parse failure, a model id that does not exist and a
 * rate limit. They arrive here as exactly two shapes: a thrown error, or text
 * that does not parse. Both are covered below, plus the partial batch.
