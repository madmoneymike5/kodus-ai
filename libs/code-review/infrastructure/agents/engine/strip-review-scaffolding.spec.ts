 * Pull request #1851, 2026-09-04 01:24:10 UTC. The formatter had aborted 13
 * seconds earlier at its 90-second ceiling (`[FORMATTER] Formatting failed:
 * This operation was aborted`, 01:23:57.714), so the batch fell back to raw
 * content and the reviewer's internal scaffolding was posted to the pull
 * request for a customer to read.
