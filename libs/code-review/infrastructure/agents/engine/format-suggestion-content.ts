 * chosen too close to the work. 120s buys headroom for a large batch or a slow

 * What ships when the model pass gives us nothing for a suggestion.
 *
 * Every failure path below used to `return new Map()`, and the caller's loop
 * over an empty map left `suggestionContent` as the finder wrote it -- the
 * WHAT/WHY/HOW scaffolding the review prompt asks for. Production, twelve
 * hours: 86 of 732 runs (11.7%) ended that way, and every suggestion in those
 * batches reached a customer's pull request with the labels intact.
 *
 * The five causes were unrelated -- a suspended account (55), the 90s ceiling
 * (25), a parse failure, a model id that does not exist, a rate limit -- so no
 * fix aimed at one of them removes the symptom. Stripping the labels locally
 * removes it for all five: it cannot time out, cannot be rate limited, and does
 * not care whether the account has credit.
 *
 * The model pass is still the polish and still preferred; this is the floor.
 * Suggestions that are already prose are returned untouched.
