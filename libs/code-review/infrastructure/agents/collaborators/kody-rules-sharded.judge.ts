/**
 * Deterministic sharded judge for kody-rules (issue #1449).
 *
 * The agentic KodyRulesAgentProvider under-covers because it lets the LLM
 * decide which files to open inside a turn budget; on large PRs the violating
 * file is never read (measured: gpt-5.4 40%, kimi 58% occurrence-recall).
 *
 * This replaces the traversal with a DETERMINISTIC sweep: code iterates every
 * changed file × its path-applicable rules and issues ONE single-shot LLM call
 * per file with those rules batched in. Coverage becomes a structural guarantee
 * — the model only judges "does this diff violate these rules?", never decides
 * where to look. Validated on the frozen github-cases benchmark: 91-100%
 * occurrence-recall across gpt-5.4 / gpt-5.4-mini / kimi, ~same-or-lower cost.
 *
 * Pure orchestration: the LLM call is injected as `runJudge` so this is
 * unit-testable against replayed diffs without a live model (same contract the
 * evals use). PR-level rules (scope: pull_request) get one whole-PR call.
 *
 * Out of scope here (later phases): the T0 regex compiler, T2 reference-file
 * inlining, hybrid regex+judge, compound-rule decomposition.
