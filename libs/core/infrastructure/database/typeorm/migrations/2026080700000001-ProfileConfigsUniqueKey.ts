 * UNIQUE(profile_id, configKey) on profile_configs.
 *
 * Doubles as (a) the lookup index for the hot
 * `findOne({ profile: { uuid }, configKey })` path AND (b) the
 * DB-level guard against the race that
 * ProfileConfigService.createOrUpdateConfig used to hit — the prior
 * `forEach(async ...)` (see commit that fixed it) dropped the
 * returned promises, so two concurrent callers could both see null
 * on findOne and both take the create branch, producing duplicate
 * rows. Even after the code fix the UNIQUE is worth having to keep
 * any future caller (or a redelivered outbox event) from ever
 * writing a duplicate.
 *
 * Shipped separately from the other hot-path indexes because a
 * preflight de-dup step is required: the UNIQUE build would fail on
 * any existing duplicate rows produced by the historical race.
