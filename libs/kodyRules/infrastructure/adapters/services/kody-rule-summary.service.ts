/**
 * Structured validation summaries for LONG kody rules.
 *
 * Long rules (walls of CLAUDE.md text) bury the enforceable point; the shard
 * judge's recall tracks how digestible the rule is. Replacing the body of a
 * >1000-char rule with LLM-extracted "WHAT TO VALIDATE / HOW TO VALIDATE"
 * bullets (examples untouched — ruleBlock renders them separately) nearly
 * doubled occurrence-recall on terse models (gpt-5.4-mini 32%→59% avg) with no
 * regression on strong ones (kimi peak 95%, glm stable). Validated on the
 * Rails convention analog cases; see docs/plans/
 * kody-rules-summary-productization.md — including the variants that were
 * tried and REJECTED (examples-first ordering, verdict checklists, a third
 * "when not to flag" section — all reduced recall; don't re-add them).
 *
 * The summary is consumed EXCLUSIVELY by the review path (resolveForReview);
 * UI/sync/export always see the full rule text. `sourceHash` (sha256 of the
 * exact text the summary was generated from) is the correctness guard: rules
 * are written by many call sites, so a hook can be missed — a stale summary is
 * detected by hash mismatch, logged, and never used.
