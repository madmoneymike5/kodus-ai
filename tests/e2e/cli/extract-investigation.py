"""Split the investigation agent's stdout into the two contract files.

The agent runs strictly read-only (Write/Bash denied by policy — it reads
untrusted droplet logs, and a later step executes checkout code with a
token), so its whole output arrives on stdout: a markdown report ending
in one fenced ```json block. This trusted script materializes
investigation.md (report, without the JSON fence) and investigation.json
(the parsed block) for the summary/upsert steps.

Advisory: on any problem it prints a notice and exits 0 — the upsert
step already tolerates a missing/invalid investigation.json.

Usage: extract-investigation.py <raw-agent-output> [out-dir]
