/**
 * Execution HEALTH assertion: the review's automation execution must end
 * in `success` — not `partial_error` ("completed with warnings", i.e. an
 * agent or auxiliary stage crashed) and not `error`.
 *
 * Why this exists: a review can still post findings while an entire agent
 * died (observed live: the finder crashing on malformed model output, 9
 * hits/hour on a customer instance, every scenario still green). Output
 * asserts don't see that; only the execution status does.
 */
/**
 * Wait until the PR's in-flight automation has SETTLED, so a follow-up
 * trigger is not refused as a duplicate.
 *
 * Opening a PR starts an automation that takes a per-PR distributed lock
 * (`CODE_REVIEW:<org>:<repo>:<pr>`, 60s TTL) before the pipeline decides
 * anything -- including before it decides to skip. Anything arriving while
 * that lock is held is answered with "Code review already being processed"
 * and dropped, with no retry.
 *
 * Best effort by design: if no automation row ever appears, there is nothing
 * holding the lock and the caller should proceed. This waits for a fact
 * instead of sleeping a fixed interval, which is what made the same scenario
 * pass on fast providers and fail on bitbucket (#1699).
